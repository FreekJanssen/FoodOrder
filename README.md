### About 

Burrito Order is web-application that allows customers to quickly order Mexican food.
On the 'order online' page, customers can compose their meals, and add them to their order.
Admin accounts can view orders on a seperate page, which is updated automatically when a new order is placed.
It is based off of a real restaurant that quickly established this concept during COVID-lockdown.

### Goals

My goal for this project was first and foremost to build a full stack web-application from scratch, while simultaneously
trying to address a real-world 'problem'. I also wanted to use a more complicated [database model](Database_model_2.0.png) than I was used to.
While still relatively small, I managed to implement several many to many relationships in it.
